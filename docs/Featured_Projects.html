                <h3>IOT based dormitory attendance system</h3>
                <p>" Smart attendance system with the help of ESP 32 cam which will
                    drive through Micro controller and the corresponding information will be stored on
                    the cloud.Eliminate the use of RFID and biometric methods to avoid physical
                    contact with the device. In this project, I used ESP 32 cam to authenticate a
                    person. The data of each person will be stored in IoT cloud using GSM SIM800C
                    Module. When student come in front of ESP32 cam, it automatically detects,
                    recognizes, gate open and stores the information in an IoT cloud. Here I used
                    HTTPS, to store the students’ data. If unauthorized person come in front of ESP32
                    cam, it will not take as a valid ID and during that time a buzzer will alarm to indicate
                    the invalid entry. Hence the problem of proxies and unknown outside people can
                    be easily resolved. The authorized person can access these data’s anywhere from the
                    world using network connection"

                <h3>Product recommendation systems based on collaborative filtering algorithm</h3>
                <p>"Collaborative sifting is based on collecting and analyzing information on user’s behaviors, their regular exercises,
                appraisals, and foreseeing what they will like based on the similitude with other clients. This framework matches people
                with comparable interface and gives suggestions based on these coordinating. Our objective is to build a recommendation
                engine to suggest similar items to clients based on their past ratings for other items. For this reason, to begin with,
                We are going to perform Exploratory Data Analysis [EDA] and after that implement recommendation algorithms with
                Collaborative algorithms."</p>
